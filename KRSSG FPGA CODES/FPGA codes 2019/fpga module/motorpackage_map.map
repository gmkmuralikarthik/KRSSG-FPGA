  Number of MUXCYs used:                       284 out of   2,860    9%
  Number of LUT Flip Flop pairs used:          743
    Number with an unused Flip Flop:           287 out of     743   38%

  A LUT Flip Flop pair for this architecture represents one LUT paired with
  one Flip Flop within a slice.  A control set is a unique combination of
  clock, reset, set, and enable signals for a registered element.
  The Slice Logic Distribution report is not meaningful if the design is
  over-mapped for a non-slice resource or if Placement fails.
